1. Explain why adding and removing liquidity to your exchange does not change the exchange rate.


# TODO: answer question 1 here
Assuming we have xy = k, and y/x = M, and we are adding Δy ETH liquidity to the pool. We will also take Δx=Δy/M coins from the liquidity provider. 
Doing so results in (y+Δy)/(x+Δx) = (y+Δy)/(x+Δy/M) = (My+MΔy)/(Mx+Δy) = M(y+Δy)/(y+Δy) = M. So the exchange rate remains the same.

2. Explain your scheme for rewarding liquidity providers and justify the design decisions you made. How does it satisfy the liquidity rewards requirements outlined in Section 7?


# TODO: answer question 2 here
1. every eth and token exchange is charged 2% fee.
2. When swap, the user only get 98% worth of their swapping asset.
3. A mapping of liquidity provider to reward in both ETH and token is used for storing reward. The amount of reward is saved as actual number of ETH or token. The rewards are assigned based on their fractional share of liquidity pool 
at the moment of the swap. When liquidity providers remove liquidity, their reward will also be returned to them based on the portion of liquidity they are withdrawing. If a liquidity provider withdraws all of his liquidity, all reward
will be returned. if he only withdraws half of his liquidity, only half of the reward will be returned.
4. when charging exchange fee, the fee will be saved as uninvested_token and uninvested_eth. The algorithm will do nothing if either one of those value is zero. When after an exchange, both values are nonzero, the smaller worth of 
uninvested_token and uninvested_eth will be reinvested back into the pool along with equivalent amount of the other coin based on their exchange rate at that moment.

3. Describe at least one method you used to minimize your exchange contract's gas usage. Why was this method effective?
